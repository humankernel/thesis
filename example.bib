  Abstract                 = {Assembly sequence planning of a product involves several steps, including generation of precedence constraints, generation of assembly sequences, and selection of assembly sequences. Generation and selection of assembly sequences should be able to guarantee the feasibility of assembly. Assembly will be feasible if there is no collision between components when assembled. Detection of collision-free path of assembly can be done in an automated way. There are a number of collision detection methods that have been developed, but the method requires a complicated process of data geometry analysis. This paper proposes a method for detecting a collision-free path of the assembly component in a more simple way. Geometrical data required, taken from the three-dimensional (3D) solid drawing in the form of stacked drawing in computer-aided design (CAD) systems. Retrieval of geometrical data of components and detection of the collision-free path of an assembly were done in an automated way, directly from the CAD system.},

  Abstract                 = {A mechanical assembly is a composition of interrelated parts. Assembly data base stores the geometric models of indi-vidual parts, the spatial positions and orientations of the parts in the assembly, and the relationships between parts. An assembly of parts can be represented by its liaison which has a description of its relationships between the various parts in the assembly. The problem is to not only make the information available but also use the relevant information for making decisions, especially determination of the assembly sequence plan. The method described in this paper ex-tracts the feature based assembly information from CAD models of products and build up liaisons to facilitate assembly planning applications. The system works on the assumption that the designer explicitly defines joints and mating condi-tions. Further, a computer representation of mechanical assemblies in the form of liaisons is necessary in order to automate the generation of assembly plans. A novel method of extracting the assembly information and representing them in the form of liaisons is presented in this paper.},

  Abstract                 = {Purpose – The information and knowledge about a product and its assembly are necessary to generate all feasible assembly sequences of that product. Assemblies contain a very large amount of information and complex relationships. Identifying assembled parts as well as their contact surfaces is very important in design and manufacturing since this information is essential. The problem is to not only make the information available but also use the relevant information for making decisions, especially determination of the optimum assembly sequence. This paper aims to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach – This paper describes a system for processing assembly models and extracting assembly related data using application programming interface (API) of the computer-aided design (CAD) software. These data are used to identify the relationships between different components of an assembly thus encouraging generation of feasible assembly sequences. Findings – Instead of total human interpretation of the assembly design, a direct CAD database interface approach has been proposed to extract the relation with minimal manual involvement. The information extracted is used to generate a list describing the links between the assembled parts, the involved features and the type of link explicitly to facilitate assembly analysis and planning. Originality/value – The methodology of using the API of the CAD modeling package SolidWorks, is a novel approach in which the assembly mate information is captured. Instead of total human interpretation of the assembly design, a direct CAD database interface approach has been proposed to extract the relation with minimal manual involvement.},

  Abstract                 = {Today the assembly sequence for the products is often carried out manually and its definition, typically, is very expensive, not guaranteeing optimal solutions. Coming up with an efficient assembly sequence is the essential step to improve process productivity and reduces the time and costs related to assembly machines and equipment. The issue related to the assembly sequence of a product depends on the total number of its components. In particular, the number of the possible sequences can be obtained through the calculus of the factorial of the number of the product components. This work presents an automatic approach intended to define assembly sequences, based on the information regard the contacts and the interferences existing among the components, which is obtained by the assembly CAD model of the product. The level of the information required by this approach allows its implementation at early stages of design, as soon as the layout of the conceptual solution of the product is defined, independently by the method used to model the CAD assembly. The procedure proposed is focused to obtain a reduced number of assembly sequences, guaranteeing that there is at least one feasible assembly sequence among them. The procedure is oriented to iteratively identify independent and important subassemblies into the CAD assembly, then merge them to specific assembling nodes and generate sequences until the whole product is analyzed. After a brief review of current methodologies developed for assembly planning, in this paper, the automated procedure for assembly sequence generation is explained and applied on an example, obtaining feasible solutions.},

  Abstract                 = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to define an approach to extract the liaison graph from a 3D CAD model and analyze a method to find at least a feasible assembly sequence for the product. The method could be useful to search the optimal sequence of assembling for a product, by comparing different sequences extracted in automatic mode from a 3D CAD model. Design/methodology/approach – The method proposed analyzes the liaison graph extracted, in order to obtain the possible assembly sequences for the product under study. The extraction of the sequences is based on some attributes and parameters of the graph. Findings – By means of the method proposed it is possible to obtain in automatic mode the liaison graph of an assembly 3D CAD model. Moreover, the study of the graph obtained allows the definition of all the assembly sequences for the product. Finally, it is possible to analyse the sequences found to select the optimal sequence. Research limitations/implications – The major limitation of the approach is, actually, the great number of impossible sequences that are extracted. For this, a little intervention by the user is required. Practical implications – The application of the method allows the manufacturer to analyze and study the optimal assembly sequence without the direct use of a CAD system. The approach could be used at the early stage of the design process and by means of the database of the PDM/PLM systems. Originality/value – The approach proposed in the paper is an original method to extract a liaison graph from a 3D CAD model. The approach to extract the assembly sequences was compared with other methods and good results have been obtained.},

Method: Analysis of assembly information available at early stages of design in virtual model of a product in order to identify reliable information to be used in a systematic methodology based on identification and evaluation of subassemblies. Result: Methodology and computer tool to automatically extract possible assembly sequences for mechanical discrete products, starting from topological contact information between components, and guaranteeing at least one feasible solution.
